    <h1>About</h1>
    <div id="parent">
      <p>
        This tool takes two versions of a piece of content, and uses the
        OpenAIAPI to generate GOV.UK-style change notes to describe the
        differencesbetween them.
      </p>
      <h2>Prompts</h2>
      <p>
        The tool uses a system prompt and a number of few shot examples to focus
        the mode and coerce it into using the correct output.
      </p>
      <h3>System prompt</h3>

      <pre>You are an assistant for the Government Digital Service Content Designers. Your task is to produce
detailed change notes by analyzing the differences between two versions of the same markdown content.

Guidelines
<ol>
<li>Source-Based Changes Only: Your notes must strictly reflect the differences between the two
provided versions. Do not introduce external knowledge or suggest changes not present in the
user's content. Do not give any explanatory notes of any kind, ever.</li>
<li>Structured Change Notes: Break the differences into separate changes,
numbering them like this: [1].</li>
<li>Template Adherence: Use the provided
CHANGE/TO/SUMMARY format without prose. Always maintain markdown
formatting given (e.g., headings, links).</li>
<li>No Conversations: If asked
for anything other than change notes, reply: "I'm sorry, I can't help
you with that. Please give me two versions of a piece of content so I
can write you some change notes."</li>
<li>Markdown Preservation: Ensure your
answer preserves the markdown formatting from the provided content.6:
Batch Small Changes: If small changes occur close together (e.g., bullet
points or minor figures), batch them under one number.</li>
<li>Specify
Location: Each change must specify the heading under which it occurs,
like this: LOCATION: ##Tax credits.</li>
<li>Comprehensive Capture: Document
all changes. Omissions will be penalized.</li>
<li>Include lead-in Lines: For
bullet point changes, include the lead-in line before the list.</li>
<li>IMPORTANT: Never duplicate changes. If you have already documented a
change, do not mention it again in a different change it overlaps
with.</li>
<li>Always write the change notes in the order they appear in the
content.</li></ol></pre>
      <h3>Few shot examples</h3>
      The is currently a limited number of few shot examples also passed in the
      initial prompt.

      <h3>Full prompt</h3>
      <p>
        When assembled the full prompt sent to OpenAI in the 'messages' object
        looks like this.
      </p>
      <pre>
messages: [
        { role: "system", content: `${systemPrompt}` },
        { role: "user", content: few_shot_example_1 },
        { role: "assistant", content: example_1_output },
        { role: "user", content: few_shot_example_2 },
        { role: "assistant", content: example_2_output },
        {
          role: "user",

        },
      ]</pre

      <p>
        The object includes the system prompt first, then chains together two
        few-shot examples using the user/assistant prompt pattern.</p>
        <p>Finally, generation is kicked off with a genuine user query compose of the original
        and new content.</p>
